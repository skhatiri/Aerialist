# Kubernetes Test Execution

Aerialist can also deploy test executions on a Kubernetes cluster to facilitate running tests in the cloud. Specifically, as can be seen in the below figure, Aerialist can run multiple executions of the same test case in isolated Kubernets pods in parallel, and gather test results for further processing.

This feature is specifically helpful when performing test generation tasks, where UAV's flight could be subject to non-determinism and multiple simulations are required.

Aerialist can connect both to a cloud Kubernetes cluster, or a local instance (more useful during development).

- Requirements:
  - [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
    - [Set default context and namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/#kubectl-context-and-configuration) to your prefered clster and namespace if needed
  - [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq#install)

      ```bash
      wget https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/download/v4.22.1/yq_linux_amd64 -O /usr/bin/yq &&\
          chmod +x /usr/bin/yq
      ```

## Using Local Kubernetes Instance (Experimental)

<!-- Note: Make sure to use the latest branch (ie. refactor-docker-agent) to build the docker image -->
This guide explains how to set up a local Kubernetes instance using Docker Desktop for the purpose of running a specific task.

1. **Install Docker Desktop**: Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) on your Ubuntu machine.

2. **Enable Local Kubernetes**: In Docker Desktop, enable local Kubernetes. You can find this option in the Docker Desktop settings.

3. **Generate a Kubeconfig File**: Open a terminal and run the following command to generate a kubeconfig file for your local Kubernetes instance:
   `kubectl config view --raw --minify > k8s-config.yaml`

4. **Upload Kubeconfig as a ConfigMap**: Create a Kubernetes ConfigMap named k8s-config by uploading the kubeconfig file generated:
   `kubectl create configmap k8s-config --from-file k8s-config.yaml`

5. **Enable Use of Docker Volumes**: Edit your `.env` file and set the environment variable `KUBE_USE_VOLUME` to `True` in your environment. This will enable the use of docker volumes instead of cloud storage to share files with simulation containers.

6. **Specify Path Address**:  Edit your test description file (eg. [`mission1-k8s.yaml`](../samples/tests/mission1-k8s.yaml)) file and set the variable `path` under the section `agent` to a desired path. Container inputs and outputs (simulation logs, etc. ) will be copied to this address.

7. **Run the Task**: `python3 aerialist exec --test samples/tests/mission1-k8s.yaml`

## Using Cloud Kubernetes Cluster

Aerialist uses a [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/) instance to share files between the main container, and the parallel test executers. You can get a free account in [a cloud provider](https://nextcloud.com/sign-up/) or deploy your own [dockerized instance](https://hub.docker.com/_/nextcloud).

1. Set your NextCloud credentials and address in as a k8s-Secret:
  `kubectl create secret generic webdav --from-literal=host=https://[your-nextcloud-address]/remote.php/dav/files/[your-account-id]/ --from-literal=user=[username] --from-literal=pass=[password]`

2. Upload your [`k8s-config.yaml`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) as a k8s-ConfigMap:
  `kubectl create configmap k8s-config --from-file k8s-config.yaml`

3. You can now use `--agent k8s` in the commands to run the simulations in your k8s-cluster.
  `python3 aerialist exec --test samples/tests/mission1.yaml --agent k8s -n 5 --id mission-test --path webdav://`
